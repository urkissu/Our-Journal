<h3>Niharika: Omg, There is no words or emoji to show how i feel.How much sorry will u say ðŸ˜­ It's the best mistake u ever made. U know, In the beginning I was finding reasons to not fall for u but man That was impossibel. Everything was so naturally perfect, not Forced just natural. I was waiting for this day for soooooooooooool long, I had a crush on u even before we went out together. And I have to admit it today, It was a lie when I said I was scared in the haunted house, I just wanted to hold your hands.</h3>

<h3>Me: Will you be my gugfriend?</h3>
<h3>Niharika: Yes, Aab jaldi se utho</h3>



<h4>I just love you so much. please hold my hands forever just like u wanted to hold my hands in our first hangout and once you hold it just know that i am never gonna leave those handsâ™¡.</h4>
